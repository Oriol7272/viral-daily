The previous AI engineer successfully transformed a basic concept into a Viral Daily application. Key work involved establishing a React frontend, FastAPI backend, and MongoDB integration, although MongoDB usage appears limited in the final shared code. Core features like multi-platform video aggregation, a subscription system, and a professional UI were iteratively developed.

A significant effort was dedicated to implementing a multi-faceted monetization model, with a strong focus on PayPal integration. This involved extensive debugging of PayPal credentials, navigating sandbox and live environments, and repeatedly updating environment variables and testing the backend until live PayPal transactions were confirmed functional. The engineer also addressed a critical bug where videos failed to load due to incorrect data typing in the backend's ad injection logic, and later refined the video aggregation to include real YouTube and Twitter data, alongside highly realistic mock data for TikTok and Instagram. The latest interaction involves the user experiencing a web not loading issue on their local machine after receiving the full codebase, indicating a local environment or setup problem.

The Viral Daily application's core purpose is to aggregate and deliver the 10 most viral videos of youtube, X, tiktok and perhaps instagram. Users should be able to watch videos on the app or receive them daily via email, Telegram, or WhatsApp.

Monetization is a key requirement, encompassing:
1.  **Premium Subscriptions (SaaS Model):** Free, Pro, and Business tiers offering varying access to features like unlimited videos, platform access, and API calls.
2.  **Advertising Revenue:** Display ads and sponsored content.
3.  **Creator Economy, Data & Analytics, E-commerce:** These were broader strategies outlined but not fully implemented within this trajectory.

The current implementation provides a functional UI for video aggregation (using real APIs for YouTube/Twitter, and highly realistic mock data for TikTok/Instagram), a user authentication and subscription system with Free, Pro, and Business tiers, and fully functional PayPal payment processing in EUR currency with live credentials. The application also includes an advertising injection mechanism and basic analytics infrastructure.

<key_technical_concepts>
-   **Full-stack Architecture:** React (frontend), FastAPI (backend), MongoDB (database).
-   **API Integration:** YouTube Data API v3 (real), Twitter API v2 (real), TikTok (enhanced mock), Instagram (enhanced mock).
-   **Payment Gateways:** PayPal (fully functional with live credentials), Stripe (conceptual/mocked).
-   **Environment Variables:** Secure management of API keys and URLs.
-   **Python Virtual Environments:** For dependency management.
-   **Dynamic SVG Generation:** For mock video thumbnails.

<code_architecture>
The application follows a standard full-stack structure:



-   : The original main FastAPI file. While a full  was initially provided, the iterative development and user's difficulty with local setup led to the creation and sharing of , , , and . The  represents the most feature-rich backend delivered, integrating real YouTube and Twitter APIs, and advanced realistic mock data for TikTok and Instagram, handling all video aggregation logic and API endpoints for subscriptions and payments.
-   : Crucial for storing , , and various API keys (, , , ). This file has been repeatedly updated with real PayPal and YouTube API keys provided by the user.
-   : Defines Pydantic models for , , , , , , . It was updated to include  in the  enum.
-   : Manages subscription tiers and their features.
-   : The main React component, responsible for displaying videos, managing platform filters, and controlling the visibility of subscription/payment modals and the user dashboard. It fetches video data from the backend.
-   : Handles the payment flow, allowing users to choose between Stripe (mocked) and PayPal (functional).
-   : Renders the PayPal payment button and manages client-side PayPal order creation, interacting with the backend.
-   : Lists Node.js dependencies, including .
-    and : Documentation files created to guide the user on deployment and summarize the project's status.

The project structure also shows the presence of , , ,  in the backend, indicating modules for these functionalities, though the full extent of their implementation beyond what's in  wasn't always detailed in the trajectory.

<pending_tasks>
-   **Resolve local setup issues:** Ensure the user can run the  and the frontend reliably on their machine.
-   **Implement real TikTok API:** Beyond current ultra-realistic mock data.
-   **Implement real Instagram Graph API:** Beyond current ultra-realistic mock data, potentially requiring a business account.
-   Implement SendGrid for daily email subscriptions.
-   Implement Telegram Bot API for notifications.
-   Implement Twilio for WhatsApp/SMS delivery.
-   **Frontend Testing:** Thoroughly test the PayPal integration and video display on the frontend once the local environment is stable.

<current_work>
Immediately prior to this summary, the AI engineer was focused on getting the full Viral Daily application to run on the user's local machine. This involved:
1.  **Integrating all platforms:** The  was provided, which includes real YouTube API, real Twitter API (assuming user provides Bearer Token), and sophisticated, ultra-realistic mock data for TikTok and Instagram due to their restrictive APIs. This version dynamically creates SVG thumbnails for mock data.
2.  **Troubleshooting user's local environment:** The user reported la web no se carga (the web does not load) after attempting to run the latest backend version. The AI engineer was in the process of diagnosing this, specifically checking for running processes and suggesting a fallback to  (a minimal backend version that reliably serves mock videos and payment endpoints) to get something working for the user.
3.  **Providing step-by-step guidance:** The AI engineer was giving explicit  commands and execution instructions for the user to manually set up the project files and run the servers, given their difficulties with downloading archives or using .

The current state is that the user has reported la web no se carga, indicating that the  version (which represents the most advanced backend code provided by the AI engineer) is not successfully starting or connecting, preventing the frontend from loading videos. The last action by the AI was to provide instructions for running a simpler, more robust backend () to confirm basic connectivity and functionality.
